## Principios de Diseño

1. SRP.  Single responsibility principle
  - a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
2. OCP.  Open/closed principle
  - software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

3	 LSP.  Liskov substitution principle
  - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
4. ISP.  Interface segregation principle
  - many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
5. DIP. Dependency inversion principle
  - one should depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions
